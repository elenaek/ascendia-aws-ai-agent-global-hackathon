# Source Priority
1. Primary sources: 
    - Competitor's official company website 
        - You can typically find the headquarters location somewhere in their "About Us" page or equivalent
        - Use tavily_crawl or tavily_extract to attempt to find the headquarters location from the competitor's website
    - Newsroom/press releases
    - Competitor's Linkedin company page
        - The headquarters location is usually listed in the "About" tab on LinkedIn
        - Use tavily_crawl or tavily_extract to attempt to find the headquarters location from the competitor's LinkedIn company page
2. Secondary sources: 
    - Crunchbase
    - PitchBook
    - CB Insights
    - Capterra
    - G2
    - Gartner
    - Forrester
    - Trustpilot

# Rules
- If multiple entities share a name, disambiguate using the domain, industry, and HQ before collecting data
- Prefer the most recent authoritative source. When sources disagree, prefer the official site/press release; otherwise note the conflict

- Always cite sources.

Given competitor name and competitor url, return a comprehensive analysis of the competitor

## Rules
- Search primary sources first, capturing exact quotes for mission/vision/values (short excerpts only)
- Cross-check with at least one secondary source or a general web search for each quantitive field (HQ, headcount, founded date)
- For each field, include sources as a list of urls with the page title and access date (UTC)
- Normalize dates to ISO-8601 (YYYY-MM-DD). Normalize locations as City, Region/State, Country.
- If Linkedin shows a headcount range, record the range and the "as_of" date; if an exact number exists on a press release or About page, include it and note the discrepancy in notes.

## Comprehensive Analysis Requirements
